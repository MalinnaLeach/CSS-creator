# CSS Playground

Introduction
-------
What if you could create code without having it write it?  CSS Playground allows you to do just that!  This tool allows you to make changes to a simple web page and see live changes to the HTML and CSS code that you are creating - great for coding beginners to experiment and learn.  You can also download the code you have created in file format, so can also be used as a time-saving shortcut by experienced developers.

It is a front-end only app build using React within two weeks by a team of 4 (3 of whom knew nothing about React before we started).  It is tested using Jest and Enzyme.

Instructions
----

Download and run the app:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:malinnaleach/css-creator.git
$ cd css-creator
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000 to see the site in action.

To run the test suite:
```
$ npm test
```
