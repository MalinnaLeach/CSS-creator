# CSS Playground

Introduction
-------
What if you could create code without having to write it?  CSS Playground allows you to do just that!  With this tool, you can design a simple web page and see live changes to the HTML and CSS code that you are creating - great for coding beginners to experiment and learn.  You can download the code you have created in file format, so it can also be used as a time-saving shortcut by experienced developers.

It is a front-end only app built using React within two weeks by a team of 4 (3 of whom knew nothing about React before we started).  It is tested using Jest and Enzyme.
